# üö¶ Comparative Traffic Light Simulation Results

## üìä **Simulation Overview**

**Duration**: 10 minutes (600 seconds)
- **Phase 1 (0-5 min)**: Normal traffic light operation
- **Phase 2 (5-10 min)**: Adaptive traffic light control

**Traffic Mix**: üöó Cars + üèçÔ∏è Motorcycles/Bikes for realistic diversity
- **Car flows**: Reduced to ~630 veh/h (60% of mix)
- **Motorcycle flows**: Added ~602 veh/h (40% of mix)
- **Total traffic**: ~1,232 vehicles/hour across all directions

| Peak Waiting Time | 29.0 seconds | 33.6 seconds | +15.9% |

### **Traffic Volume Analysis**
| Metric | Normal Mode | Adaptive Mode | Change |
|--------|-------------|---------------|---------|
| Average Vehicle Count | **117.1 vehicles** | **217.9 vehicles** | **+86.1%** ‚úÖ |
| Network Capacity | Lower utilization | Higher utilization | Better throughput |

### **Traffic Pressure Analysis**
| Direction | Normal Mode | Adaptive Mode | Difference |
|-----------|-------------|---------------|------------|
| North-South Pressure | 213.3 | 445.8 | +109.0% |
| East-West Pressure | 199.8 | 562.7 | +181.6% |

## üîç **Critical Observations**

### ‚ùå **Areas Needing Improvement**
1. **Waiting Time Degradation**: Adaptive mode **doubled** waiting times
   - Suggests algorithm parameters need optimization
   - May be over-prioritizing one direction too long

2. **Pressure Imbalance Worsened**: 766% increase in NS-EW pressure difference
   - Adaptive control created more uneven traffic distribution
   - Algorithm may be too reactive to short-term pressure changes

### ‚úÖ **Positive Results**
1. **Higher Network Throughput**: 86% more vehicles handled
   - System successfully managed increased traffic volume
   - Better utilization of intersection capacity

2. **Mixed Vehicle Types**: Successfully integrated cars and motorcycles
   - More realistic traffic simulation
   - Demonstrates system flexibility

   - Clear visualization of mode transition at 5-minute mark

2. **`traffic_summary_comparison.png`**: 
   - Bar chart comparing key metrics between normal and adaptive modes
   - Quick visual reference for performance differences

## üí° **Recommendations for Algorithm Improvement**

### **Immediate Tuning Needs**:
1. **Reduce Minimum Green Time**: Current thresholds may be too high
   ```python
   self.min_green_time = 10  # Consider reducing to 7-8 seconds
   ```

2. **Adjust Pressure Calculation Weights**: 
   ```python
   # Current: pressure = vehicles + (waiting/10.0) + speed_factor
   # Consider: pressure = vehicles*0.7 + (waiting/15.0) + speed_factor*0.5
   ```

3. **Fine-tune Phase Transition Timing**:
   - Reduce maximum green time from 60s to 45s
   - Add momentum factor to prevent rapid switching

### **Algorithm Enhancement Ideas**:
1. **Historical Pressure Smoothing**: Use 3-5 measurement rolling average
2. **Predictive Timing**: Look ahead based on approaching vehicle detection
3. **Balance Penalty**: Add penalty for large pressure imbalances

## üöÄ **Next Steps**

### **Short-term (Next Simulation)**:
1. **Parameter Tuning**: Implement recommended algorithm adjustments
2. **Extended Duration**: Run 20-30 minute simulation for more stable metrics
3. **Rush Hour Testing**: Test during simulated peak traffic periods

### **Medium-term Improvements**:
1. **Real-time Optimization**: Implement machine learning for parameter adaptation
2. **Multi-objective Optimization**: Balance waiting time AND pressure balance
3. **Emergency Vehicle Priority**: Add high-priority vehicle handling

### **Long-term Research**:
1. **Multi-intersection Coordination**: Network-wide optimization
2. **Real Data Integration**: Use actual traffic patterns for validation
3. **IoV Integration**: Connected vehicle communication for predictive control

## üìä **Data Quality Assessment**

‚úÖ **Strengths**:
- Clear phase separation (normal vs adaptive)
- Consistent 30-second data collection intervals
- Mixed vehicle types for realism
- Comprehensive metrics coverage

‚ö†Ô∏è **Limitations**:
- Short simulation duration (10 minutes)

## üéâ **Conclusion**

The comparative simulation successfully demonstrated:

1. **Methodology Works**: Clear differentiation between normal and adaptive control modes
2. **Mixed Traffic Capability**: System handles cars and motorcycles effectively  
3. **Comprehensive Analysis**: Generated actionable insights for algorithm improvement
4. **Areas for Optimization**: Identified specific parameters needing adjustment

**Overall Assessment**: The adaptive algorithm shows **potential for network throughput improvement** but requires **parameter tuning to reduce waiting times** and **improve pressure balance**.
