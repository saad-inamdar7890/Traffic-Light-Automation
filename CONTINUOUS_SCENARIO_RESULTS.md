### **Key Insights**

#### ✅ **Successful Continuous Operation**
- All scenarios ran without network clearing between them
- Smooth transitions from normal to adaptive phases
- Consistent data collection throughout 81-minute simulation
- Perfect network reset between major phases (0 vehicles remaining)

- **Heavy Direction**: Successfully created 4x NS vs 0.3x EW imbalance
- **Light Three Lanes**: East lane effectively minimized to 0.1x flow  
- **Sudden Spikes**: Programmed 3x surges detected in flow data
- **Low Traffic**: All directions reduced to 0.4x baseline successfully

#### ⚠️ **Algorithm Performance Observations**
- **Limited Overall Improvement**: Adaptive algorithm shows modest gains
- **Scenario-Dependent Results**: Performance varies by traffic pattern
- **Pressure Management**: Some reduction in traffic pressure achieved
- **Need for Tuning**: Algorithm parameters may need optimization
