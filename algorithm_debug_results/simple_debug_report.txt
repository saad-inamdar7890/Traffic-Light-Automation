ALGORITHM PERFORMANCE DEBUG REPORT
==================================================

Report Date: 2025-10-06 18:43:10

PERFORMANCE SUMMARY:
------------------------------
Normal Mode Average Wait Time: 21.8 seconds
Adaptive Mode Average Wait Time: 165.6 seconds
Performance Ratio: 7.6x (WORSE)
Total Algorithm Adaptations: 717

PROBLEM SEVERITY:
------------------------------
🚨 CRITICAL FAILURE - Algorithm making traffic 5x+ worse

DIAGNOSES:
------------------------------
🚨 CRITICAL: Waiting times over 100s indicate severe congestion
   → Algorithm may be creating traffic jams instead of resolving them
🚨 CRITICAL: 5x+ worse performance indicates fundamental algorithm failure
   → Algorithm timing logic is severely flawed
⚠️  WARNING: Very high adaptation frequency may indicate instability
   → Algorithm may be over-adapting and causing oscillations
🚨 MAJOR: Adaptive algorithm making traffic significantly worse
   → Current algorithm should be disabled immediately


IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:
------------------------------
🚨 CRITICAL ACTIONS:
1. DISABLE adaptive algorithm immediately
2. Revert all intersections to normal mode
3. Debug algorithm timing calculations
4. Fix before any deployment


CONCLUSION:
------------------------------
🚨 The adaptive algorithm is BROKEN and making traffic significantly worse.
🚧 DO NOT DEPLOY this algorithm until major fixes are implemented.
🔧 Focus on debugging timing calculation and adaptation logic.
