ENHANCED DYNAMIC SIMULATION ANALYSIS SUMMARY
==============================================

Key Improvements Made:
----------------------
1. Replaced cars/motorcycles graph with traffic efficiency analysis
2. Added 4 individual lane correlation graphs (vehicle count vs green time)
3. Enhanced performance metrics with efficiency scoring
4. Added adaptation rate analysis
5. Created performance ratio tracking

Lane-Specific Analysis:
----------------------
- North Lane: Correlation between vehicle density and green light allocation
- South Lane: Traffic pattern analysis throughout simulation phases  
- East Lane: Heavy traffic phase performance evaluation
- West Lane: Balanced traffic distribution assessment

Performance Metrics:
-------------------
- Traffic Efficiency: Vehicles served per unit waiting time
- Cumulative Performance: Total waiting time accumulation
- Adaptation Rate: Algorithm responsiveness over time
- Performance Ratio: Direct comparison metric (Adaptive vs Normal)
