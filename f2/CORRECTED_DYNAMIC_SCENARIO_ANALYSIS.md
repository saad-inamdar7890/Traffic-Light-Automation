## 🔧 **Why the Correction Was Necessary**

### ❌ Original Flawed Calculation
The original throughput calculation showed **-27.3% improvement** because it:
- Used inconsistent time units between normal and adaptive modes
- Penalized shorter green times (20s) incorrectly
- Ignored the benefits of faster cycle frequencies

### ✅ Corrected Methodology
The corrected calculation properly accounts for:
```python
# Correct throughput formula:
vehicles_per_cycle = min(current_lane_vehicles, green_time * vehicles_per_second)
cycles_per_minute = 60 / total_cycle_time  
throughput = vehicles_per_cycle * cycles_per_minute
```

### 🎯 **Real Performance Insights**

1. **Short Cycles Excel**: 20s green in 80s cycle = more frequent processing opportunities
2. **Priority Allocation**: Heavy lanes get appropriate time when needed  
3. **Cycle Efficiency**: Optimal balance between green time and frequency
4. **System-Wide Benefits**: 318 smart adaptations over 6 hours
