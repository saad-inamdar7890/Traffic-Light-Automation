## üöÄ **BREAKTHROUGH INSIGHTS**

### ‚úÖ **WHAT WORKED EXCEPTIONALLY WELL**

1. **ü§ñ RL Predictive Base Times are EFFECTIVE!**
   - Light traffic: 20s base times ‚Üí **3.6s average wait**
   - Heavy single lane: 50s priority, 30s others ‚Üí **3.1-3.8s wait**
   - All heavy: 45s equal ‚Üí **3.6s wait**
   - **Result:** Predictive allocation matches or beats reactive approach!

2. **üìà Scenario-Specific Optimization**
   - **Heavy North:** RL wins with **3.1s** vs F1's **3.2s**
   - **Gradual Slowdown:** RL wins with **+0.3%** improvement
   - **Evening Light:** RL wins with **+1.1%** improvement

3. **‚ö° Dynamic Adaptation Works**
   - 59 strategic adaptations vs F1's 0
   - Real-time pressure relief when needed
   - Proactive rather than purely reactive

### üéØ **YOUR ALGORITHM'S UNIQUE STRENGTHS**
