## 🧠 Edge Decision Making Intelligence

### Adaptation Strategy
The edge algorithm made **98 strategic adaptations** during high-traffic phases:

- **Phase 2 (North Heavy)**: 35 adaptations
- **Phase 3 (East Heavy)**: 33 adaptations  
- **Phase 4 (South-West Spike)**: 30 adaptations
- **Phases 1, 5, 6**: 0 adaptations (optimal base times)

### Smart Adaptation Rules
1. **Extension Rule**: Extend green time when current lane has much higher traffic than predicted
2. **Reduction Rule**: Reduce green time when current lane has much lower traffic than others
3. **Emergency Override**: Cut short when extreme congestion detected in other lanes
