IMPROVED ADAPTIVE ALGORITHM TEST SUMMARY
========================================

Expected Improvements:
---------------------
• Light Traffic: From -6641% to -1000% to -2000% (major improvement)
• Heavy North: From -5404% to -500% to -1000% (significant improvement)  
• Heavy East: From -8002% to -800% to -1500% (major improvement)
• Rush Hour: From -72.7% to +10% to +30% (becomes beneficial)

Key Algorithm Changes:
---------------------
1. Dynamic Adaptation Intervals:
   - CRITICAL situations: 15s response time
   - URGENT traffic: 20s response time
   - NORMAL traffic: 30s response time  
   - LIGHT traffic: 40s response time
   - MINIMAL traffic: 50s response time

2. Traffic-Aware Change Limits:
   - CRITICAL: 35% change allowed
   - URGENT: 25% change allowed
   - NORMAL: 18% change allowed
   - LIGHT: 12% change allowed
   - MINIMAL: 6% change allowed

3. Enhanced Traffic Detection:
   - Multi-factor categorization (vehicles + waiting time + speed)
   - Critical situation detection (>45s wait, >15 vehicles, stopped traffic)
   - Urgency assessment for appropriate response levels

4. Smart Timing Optimization:
   - Urgency-based weight adjustments
   - Speed-based traffic prioritization
   - Maximum timing limits to prevent excessive green phases
   - Minimum safety intervals for critical overrides

Performance Monitoring:
----------------------
- Track adaptation success rates
- Monitor actual improvement ratios
- Log critical situation responses
- Compare against baseline normal mode
